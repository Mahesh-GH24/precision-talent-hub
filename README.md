   ## Description

   This App helps to search for candidates from GitHub using GitHub API and then we could add our favorite ones to the list of potential candidates. This gets saved in the local storage and the static website is deployed in render.

   ## Technologies

   React, TypeScript, GitHub API, Render, CSS, node & npm, Local Storage

   ## Usage

   Please launch the website deployed in render using this link - https://precision-talent-hub.onrender.com/.The first candidate from the GitHub would be displayed and you could decided to Reject or Add using the buttons. If you add a candidate, that candidate would be added to the local storage and the next candidate would be displayed. If there are no longer any candidates, a standard message would be displayed and you could refresh the page to reload more random candidates. Once you are done with this page, you could click the Potential Candidates link to view the list of added candidates. If you could like to remove any of them, please click the Reject button and the candidate would be removed from the display and local storage. You could go back to the Candidate Search page by clicking the Nav item.

   ## Challenges

   During the project, I had issues with render configurations for the build and deployment process.
   

   ## Tests
   Ensure the app opens and ensure you are able to navigate into each of the pages as detailed in the usage. You may refer to the above screenshots too.

   ## Future Implementation
   Integrate with Postgres or MongoDB and add more security by allowing only registered users.
